<p>What Casbin does:</p>
<ul>
<li>enforce the policy in the classic {subject, object, action} form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.</li>
<li>handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.</li>
<li>manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).</li>
<li>support built-in superuser like root or administrator. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.</li>
<li>multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.</li>
</ul>
