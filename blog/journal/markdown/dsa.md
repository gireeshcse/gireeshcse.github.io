#### Time Complexity 

- Date: Sep 20, 2023

* Time Taken depends on system.
* Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.


* Big- Oh Notation - o(n)
    - Consider worst case scenario
    - Avoid constants and lower values

* Theta - Avg Complexity
* Omega - Lower bound complexity or best case scenario

#### Space Complexity - Memory Space

* Auxilary Space - Space that we need to solve the problem
* Input Space - Space that we need to store the input

Ex: C = A + B C is AS and A,B are Input Space

* Never do anything to input data (Manipulation of input data B = A + B)

Generally : 1 sec = 10^8 Operations, 2 secs = 2 * 10^8
